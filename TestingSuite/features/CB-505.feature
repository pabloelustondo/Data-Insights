Feature: Create TMM service
  # https://jira.soti.net/browse/CB-505

Background:
simple UI should allow customer to define data sets (CRUD operations);
each data set should allow customer to define metadata (as a bare json document for now);
user should be able to see a list of all existing data sets;
DSS should be responsible only for data sources management and the future feature of suspending incoming data belongs to DSS - it is not a data sets operation.
# add TMM positive/negative validation tests
