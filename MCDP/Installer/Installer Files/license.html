In the event that a protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this License, the Receiving Party will furnish only that Confidential Information which is legally required and will exercise reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information so disclosed.</p>
